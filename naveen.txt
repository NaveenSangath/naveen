Hi everyone.I like computers and their functions.I finished my school studies in namakkal vetrivikaas.I like this field and I am very much interested in programings and hacking also.I mostly prefers software designs.I had no idea in engineering studies.Though kct  gives a better infrastructure,I hate engineering.Ilike to be a pilot.Computer is a electronic material which helps to entertain us on both mentally and also phically.It needs a beautiful processor and mac air has only 128GB storage so I hate it.
